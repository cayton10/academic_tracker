# academic_tracker
C++ Terminal tool developed for my final project in CIT 163

Tracker tool was built with specific rules which were defined at the start of the assignment. Once completed, I'd like to 
rebuild this tool using OOP methods. We just touched on C++ classes prior to starting this project.
